**Unit 5: New Imperialism during the Long 19th Century** <span
id="5"></span> 
*The French Revolution embroiled Europe in nearly two decades of
military conflict.  At the 1815 Treaty of Vienna, war weary European
monarchies resolved to settle their political differences and jointly
suppress further outbreaks of revolutionary violence.  After 1815,
Europe entered an era of relative peace and prosperity that lasted until
World War I.  Many historians refer to this period of time from the
French Revolution to World War I as the “Long 19<sup>th</sup>
Century.”*  
  
 *During the Long 19<sup>th</sup> Century, England, France, Germany and
other European states used their military and industrial strength to
seize territories in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Ocean and subjugate
native peoples living in these territories.  European leaders viewed
overseas colonies as an important signifier of international power and
competed with each other to control larger and larger territories across
the globe.  Colonies also provided natural resources for, and consumed
manufactured goods produced by, imperial nations and served as locations
for investment by powerful industrialists in each country.  Imperialists
viewed native people in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as primitive and
uncivilized and justified racial and ethnic oppression on the grounds
that they were engaged in a “civilizing mission.”  These racist
attitudes shaped how Europeans dealt with colonial populations
throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries.  *  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine how European nations staked out claims
to colonies throughout the world and imposed new technologies and
economic systems on colonial possessions.  We will also explore the
consequences of colonization for European and colonial populations and
evaluate the impact of colonial rebellions and anti-colonial movements
during the 19<sup>th</sup> century.*
