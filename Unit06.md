**Unit 6: World War I** <span id="6"></span> 
*By the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, competition between European
states over colonial resources began to affect the cohesion of the
international community.  A growing arms race between Great Britain and
Germany also raised concerns about European stability.  In response to
these growing tensions, European nations began making secret military
alliances for mutual protection in the event of war.  Tensions finally
came to a head in the summer of 1914, when Serbian terrorists
assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary.  Germany and
Austria-Hungary threatened to invade Serbia, but Russia elected to
protect the small state.  As a result, these nations declared war on
each other and treaty alliances forced France and Great Britain to join
the conflict.  By its end in November of 1918, World War I had consumed
over eight million lives and had become the most deadly and destructive
conflict in world history.  
  
 In this unit, we will examine the origins of the war and study how and
why it spread so rapidly throughout the world.  We will also evaluate
the role that European colonies and colonized peoples played in the
conflict.  Finally, we will take a look at how European states attempted
to maintain their colonial possessions through post-war peace agreements
and how colonized peoples began to directly challenge European rule.*
