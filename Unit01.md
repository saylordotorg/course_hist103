**Unit 1: Global Networks of Exchange in the 1600s** <span
id="1"></span> 
*By the early 17<sup>th</sup>century, European merchants had established
maritime trade networks across the Atlantic Ocean and eastward to India
and China.  These networks allowed them to acquire furs, tea, sugar,
spices, and other luxury commodities that were in great demand
throughout Europe.  In the Americas, European settlers began using large
numbers of enslaved Africans to grow labor-intensive crops such as
sugarcane and tobacco for export to Europe.  Portuguese, and later
Dutch, merchants acquired many of these slaves from trade posts on the
West African coast.  Once the slaves had been sold in the Americas,
merchants used the proceeds to acquire local commodities to sell in
Europe.  This circular trade pattern dominated the Atlantic economy
until the 1800s. European nations closely guarded their trade networks
against rival states.  The Dutch East India Company, for example,
possessed its own private army and navy, which it used to defend its
trade links with India and Southeast Asia.   
  
 Global trade altered production and consumption patterns throughout the
world and led to the rapid growth and development of England and the
Netherlands at the expense of older colonial powers such as Spain and
Portugal.  In this unit, we will examine the growth of global trade
networks in the 1600s and evaluate the political, social, and cultural
impact of these networks on the peoples of Africa, Europe, and the
Americas.*

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Identify and analyze the growth of global trade networks in the
    17<sup>th</sup> century, and assess the importance of the political,
    economic, and cultural exchange along these routes.
-   Describe and analyze the rise of European empires and the parallel
    expansion of the Atlantic slave trade.
-   Assess the role of European mercantile policies in the formation of
    colonial economies and trade networks.

     As you listen to the first lecture on the first 100 years, think
    about the political and religious factors that led to the creation
    of the Dutch East Indies Company in the 1600s.  How did the firm
    represent an effort by Northern Europeans to challenge the economic
    and political power of Portugal and Spain?  As you listen to the
    second lecture on the second hundred years, think about the
    political and religious factors that led to the creation of the
    Dutch East Indies Company in the 1600s.  How did the firm represent
    an effort by Northern Europeans to challenge the economic and
    political power of Portugal and Spain?  
        
     Note on the Lecture: In this first lecture, Dr. Thomas Crump
    describes the origins and development of the Dutch East Indies
    Company, the powerful corporate trading monopoly created by Holland
    to control commercial access to East Asia, during the
    17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries.  Dr. Crump discusses
    how the East Indies Company established trading sites in India,
    China, Japan, and modern-day Indonesia to carry out business with
    local merchants, and he explains how the company used its vast
    resources to create a private army and navy to protect its vast
    trading empire.

    formed the basis of regional trade until the British East India
    Company established economic domination over the region in the
    late-17<sup>th</sup> and early-18<sup>th</sup> centuries.  The
    British discouraged local textile and metal trades and instead
    encouraged the production of opium for trade with China.  This
    disrupted regional economies and led to dramatic changes in patterns

     Instructions:  Read the excerpts from Professor Andre Gunder
    Frank’s book on the webpage.  
        
     Note on the Text: In this web posting, economic historian Andre
    Gunder Frank, who teaches at the University of Amsterdam, discusses
    the economic relationship between Europe and Asia in the
    16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries.  He argues that Asian
    nations were far wealthier and more powerful than European nations
    during these centuries and did far more to shape the world economy.
     Only in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, thanks to the Industrial
    Revolution and European colonization efforts, did European nations
    surpass Asian nations in economic power.  As you read, consider the
    historical evidence that Gunder Frank presents to support his
    arguments.  Why does he characterize Europe as the “caboose” to the
    “Asian economic train”?
