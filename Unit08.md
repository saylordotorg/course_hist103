**Unit 8: The Second World War and the New World Order** <span
id="8"></span> 
*By the late 1930s, anti-democratic governments in Europe and Asia were
beginning to threaten the security of surrounding states.  Nazi Germany
occupied parts of Czechoslovakia and Austria in 1938.  Great Britain and
France declined to challenge German actions, fearing that a firm stance
against Germany might provoke a new European war.  The following year,
Germany invaded Poland and set in motion a chain of events that led to
the outbreak of World War II.  In the Pacific, Japanese forces continued
to expand their hold on China and the military prepared invasion plans
for European colonies in Southeast Asia.  Meanwhile, the United States
chose to remain isolated from the growing conflict, as it had done
during much of World War I.*  
  
 *America entered the war in December of 1941, following a surprise
Japanese attack on American military forces in Hawaii.  American troops
joined British and French forces and began to prepare for an invasion of
Nazi occupied Europe.  In the Pacific, American and allied forces
eventually checked Japanese military expansion and began to go on the
offensive.  Like the First World War, World War II was a global war and
critical battles were fought across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the
Pacific.    
  
 In this unit, we will examine the global impact of the World War II and
look at why the United States and the Soviet Union emerged as economic,
political, and military superpowers following the conflict.  We will
also examine how the war reshaped political, economic, and social life
in Europe and Asia and led to devastating new military technologies,
such as the atomic bomb.  Finally, we will discuss how Nazi anti-Semetic
ideologies led to the Holocaust, in which six million Jews and other
minorities were systematically murdered from 1939-1945.*
