**Unit 3: Religious, Intellectual, and Political Revolutions in the
1600s-1800s** <span id="3"></span> 
*The 1600s and 1700s were a time of profound religious, intellectual,
and political turmoil across the globe.  In Europe, the Protestant
Reformation, which challenged the religious and political power of the
Catholic Church, led to the Thirty Years’ War in the early 1600s.  The
Thirty Years’ War devastated much of Central Europe and led to profound
divisions between Catholic and Protestant political states.  In Africa
and Asia, Islam continued to spread southward and eastward through trade
networks, population migrations, and the activities of missionaries.*  
  
 *The Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Church’s declining
religious and political power led to a period of great intellectual
fervor across Europe in the 1600s and 1700s.  Known as the
Enlightenment, this period witnessed the development of intellectual
movements promoting reason, democracy, political freedom, and rational
inquiry.  Enlightenment thinkers questioned civil authorities and
developed new ideas about the relationship between a nation’s
governments and its people.  These ideas gave rise to a period of
political revolutions intended to overthrow monarchical rule and to
install democratically elected governments in the late 1700s.  The
French Revolution in 1789 followed the American Revolution in 1776 and
encouraged other revolutions throughout the Americas and parts of
Europe.   
  
 In this unit, we will examine the interaction between religious and
political beliefs in the 1600s and 1700s and look at how these ideas
reshaped political, economic, and social life throughout the world by
the beginning of the 1800s.  We will also look at how political
revolutions in the Americas had a global impact on political
institutions and reshaped networks of trade and commerce throughout the
world. *

     The French Revolution began in May 1789 with the meeting of the
    Estates-General—a general assembly representing the three French
    estates of the realm: the nobility, the church, and the common
    people.  Summoned by King Louis XVI to propose solutions to his
    government’s financial problems, the Estates-General sat for several
    weeks in May and June 1789 but came to an impasse as the three
    estates clashed over their respective powers.  It was brought to an
    end when many members of the Third Estate formed themselves into a
    National Assembly, signaling the outbreak of the Revolution.  On
    July 14 of that same year, the Bastille—a medieval fortress and
    prison which represented royal authority in the center of Paris—was
    stormed by a mob that demanded the arms and ammunition stored
    there.

    the Royal Palace in Paris and arrested the King. In September, the
    Assembly abolished the monarchy and declared a republic.
