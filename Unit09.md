**Unit 9: The Cold War and Decolonization** <span id="9"></span> 
*Following World War II, many nations throughout the world began to ally
themselves with either the democratic United States or the Communist
Soviet Union.  The resulting Cold War created profound political and
economic divisions across the globe and weakened western European
colonial powers, such as Great Britain and France.  New international
political alignments and the waning power of European colonial powers
encouraged the growth of independence movements in many European
colonies.  Decolonization across Africa and Asia led to the emergence of
new independent states.  These new nations provided a battlefield for
the struggle between Capitalist and Communist political ideologies.  Due
to their military strength, the United States and the USSR could not
challenge each other directly, out of fear of mutual annihilation, but
they engaged in a series of indirect conflicts in many of the young,
developing nations throughout Africa and Asia.  *  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine how Cold War politics affected life
across much of Europe, Africa, and Asia during the second half of the
20<sup>th</sup>century.  We will also take a look at how the United
States and the Soviet Union engaged developing nations economically,
technologically, and militarily as each superpower tried to gain
political and military advantages over the other.  Finally, we will
study how nations in Europe and Asia responded to the Cold War by
creating new economic and political alliances, such as the European
Union.*
