**Unit 2: Conflict and Empire in the 1600s and 1700s** <span
id="2"></span> 
*Nations throughout the world experienced profound military and
political transformations over the course of the 17<sup>th</sup>
century.  Gunpowder technology gradually made its way from Asia through
the Middle East to Europe between the 1300s and the 1600s.  By the
beginning of the 17<sup>th</sup> century, Europeans were beginning to
perfect cannon technology and experiment with handheld firearms. These
new military technologies altered warfare across Europe and the Middle
East, and they contributed to the development of powerful, centralized
states.  Nations such as France, Russia, and Japan also witnessed the
emergence of absolutist forms of government.  Powerful kings and
emperors declared themselves to be agents of God and used the military
and political power at their disposal to demand total obedience from the
lesser nobility and the peasantry of their kingdoms.  *  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine the development of absolutism in Europe
and Asia and compare it with other forms of government.  We will also
look at the growing conflicts between European states over colonial
possessions and resources throughout the world and explore how these
conflicts altered the balance of European power in the 1600s and 1700s.*

     Domat argues that kings and princes derive all their power from God
    and consequently deserve absolute loyalty and obedience from their
    subjects.  He also asserts, however, that monarchs must always act
    justly and provide for the welfare of their subjects, even though
    they are accountable to no one but God alone.
