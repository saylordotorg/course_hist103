**Unit 10: Global Society in a Post-Cold War World** <span
id="10"></span> 
*The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 ended the bipolar military,
political, and economic alignments that had structured life across the
globe during the Cold War.  The United States emerged as the sole
remaining economic and military superpower, but the growing political
and economic power of the European Union and industrial nations across
East Asia gradually challenged this status by the beginning of the
21<sup>st</sup>century.  In the post-Cold War world, developing nations
across Africa, Asia, and the Americas struggled under a crushing burden
of international debt, lack of economic development, internecine
warfare, and the social impact of infectious diseases like AIDS and
malaria.  Now, at the end of the first decade of the
21<sup>st</sup>century, the global community faces profound challenges
brought about by climate change, religious violence, and economic
uncertainty.  *  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine the political, economic, and social
realignments that followed the end of the Cold War and look at the
consequences of globalization in the developed and developing world.  We
will evaluate current economic, political, and social trends from the
broader perspective of the past 400 years and address how the world
community can meet the challenges ahead.*

     Instructions: In this thought-provoking article, journalist and
    social commentator Kirkpatrick Sale addresses the place of
    technology and industrialization in the modern global society.  Sale
    argues that technology is not neutral and can have a detrimental
    impact on society.  Similarly, industrialization is a cataclysmic
    process that always leads to social turmoil and destruction.  He
    argues that people have a moral responsibility to take a stand
    against mindless industrialization and challenge the assumptions of
    pro-technology and pro-industry advocates.  In doing so, society
    will be able to ensure social stability, economic equality, and
    environmental reform.
