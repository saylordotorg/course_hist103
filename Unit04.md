**Unit 4: Scientific and Industrial Revolutions of the 1600s and 1700s**
<span id="4"></span> 
*The Scientific Revolution began in Europe in the 16<sup>th</sup>
century, but had the greatest impact on Europe in the 17<sup>th</sup>
and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries.  Drawing on scientific ideas developed by
the ancient Greeks and Romans, as well as Asian and Hindu-Arabic
scientific and mathematical discoveries, researchers used the scientific
method to develop the modern disciplines of astronomy, physics, biology,
and chemistry.  Discoveries by scientists challenged traditional beliefs
about the nature of matter, the operation of the solar system, and the
life processes of living organisms.  In England, these new scientific
ideas and discoveries contributed to a gradual, but profound, shift away
from traditional means of agricultural and craft production to
mechanical means for producing and transporting goods.  The development
of the steam engine in the 1700s, for example, provided an unlimited
source of energy to power mechanical devices.  Inventors soon developed
primitive machines to spin yarn, weave textiles, and perform other basic
tasks.  While these early machines often produced low-quality
manufactured products, they could produce much larger quantities of
goods than skilled craftspeople in the same amount of time.  Engineers
soon developed other applications for steam power such as railroad
locomotives and steamships.  Over the course of the 1700s, the
Industrial Revolution swept Great Britain, and the nation became a
center for the industrial production of iron, textiles, and other
manufactured goods.  Factory towns expanded rapidly as peasants left
farms for manufacturing jobs in the cities.  England’s growing
industrial might made it the most wealthy and powerful nation on the
face of the planet by the early 19<sup>th</sup> century.  In this unit,
we will examine the origins of the Scientific Revolution and evaluate
its social and political impact on European society.  We will also look
at the social, political, economic, and technological impact of the
Industrial Revolution in England and throughout the world.  We will see
how England, and later the United States, overtook other nations
industrially, economically, and militarily, and we will explore the
profound implications of this power shift.*

     Instructions: Read the entire document on the webpage.  
      
     Note on the Text: In his 1835 article “The Philosophy of
    Manufacturers,” Andrew Ure describes the new industrial system that
    had developed in England over the course of the previous century.
     He argues that the new factory system is beneficial to workers,
    since it relieves them of much of the tedium of manufacturing goods
    by hand.  He also notes that the system does away with skilled
    workers by replacing them with machines.  While machines are
    expensive, unskilled women and children can operate them for very
    low wages, which saves money for factory owners.  Ultimately, Ure
    concludes that the Industrial Revolution has benefited the people of
    England and any opposition to it is simply due to ignorance and fear
    mongering.
