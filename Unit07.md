**Unit 7: The Rise of Totalitarian States in the 20th Century** <span
id="7"></span> 
*World War I devastated Europe economically, politically, and socially.
 Great Britain and France blamed Germany for the conflict and imposed
severe economic penalties and military restrictions on the German state.
 In Russia, Communist revolutionaries seized control of the government
in 1917 and began to consolidate power and impose Communist rule
throughout Russia.  They attempted to turn Russia from an agricultural
state into a powerful industrial nation that could rival the industrial
states of western Europe.  In Asia, Japanese leaders viewed western
colonial powers with envy and began expanding the Japanese military with
the goal of eventually establishing colonies throughout Asia and the
Pacific.  *  
  
 *Following the war, liberal democratic governments came into power
throughout much of western Europe.  Under these regimes, women received
the right to vote in many states and workers were permitted to unionize.
 In states like Germany and Italy, however, democratic governments were
weak and ineffective.  After the Great Depression destroyed the German
and Italian economies in the early 1930s, voters looked for more
powerful leaders to guide them through the difficult times.  As a
result, the Nazi Party gained power in Germany, while the Fascist Party
peacefully assumed control in Italy.  Nazi and Fascist leaders promised
renewed prosperity as they began to rebuild military forces in order to
challenge the colonial powers of Great Britain and France.  Meanwhile,
in Asia, Japanese military forces landed in eastern China and began
occupying much of Manchuria.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will take a look at the rise of Communist, Fascist,
and Totalitarian governments in Europe and Asia.  We will evaluate how
economic, social, and political factors allowed profoundly
anti-democratic governments to assume power in Russia, Germany, Italy,
and Japan, and how these governments fundamentally reshaped life in
these nations during the 1920s and 1930s.*
